# Yo, I'm Nik! 🧠🚀

AI/LLM Engineer, Python Developer, and systems thinker building end-to-end AI solutions:  
from RAG pipelines and multi-agent architectures to production-grade bots, APIs, and DevOps flows.

I design, build, deploy, and scale AI-driven systems that actually work in the real world -  
automation, retrieval systems, LLM orchestration, and intelligent assistants.  
Turning chaos into architecture is my favorite sport.

## 🔥 What I Do

- **LLM Engineering**:  
  Multi-agent systems, function calling, tool orchestration, prompt engineering at scale,  
  JSON schema outputs, context optimizations, retrieval-augmented workflows.

- **RAG & Retrieval Systems**:  
  End-to-end pipelines, chunking strategies, embeddings, Qdrant, reranking, metadata routing,  
  ingestion tooling, vector DB optimization.

- **Backend Engineering (Python)**:  
  FastAPI, async architectures, Postgres, Redis, Alembic, SQLAlchemy 2.0, webhook systems  
  (Telegram, WhatsApp), message parsing, domain-level logic.

- **Bots & Automation**:  
  Production-grade Telegram/WhatsApp AI assistants with multilingual flows, i18n, payments,  
  admin dashboards, and integrated RAG knowledge bases.

- **DevOps & Deployment**:  
  Docker, docker-compose, systemd services, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Ubuntu VPS, monitoring,  
  secure API integrations, environment management.

## 🧩 Current Focus

- Building **enterprise-level AI assistants** with RAG, memory, and multi-step reasoning.  
- Architecture of **modular toolstores**, **agent routers**, **prompt stores**, and **model abstractions**.  
- Designing LLM-first backends with clean boundaries and predictable tool execution.  
- Adoptive pipelines for production: ingestion, validation, observability, evaluation.
