## # Yo, I’m Nick! 🧠

I’m an AI Engineer and ML enthusiast diving headfirst into the wild world of NLP, LLMs, and Python. 🐍 Just started sharing my projects publicly. Ex-closet coder, now building cool stuff 😜. Whether it’s crafting clever prompts or hacking together RAG pipelines, I’m all about turning data into magic. Let’s make some AI noise! 🚀

## My Stack 🔥
- **Python 3.10+**: My go-to for AI and ML.
- **NLP & LLMs**: SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face, ChromaDB.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts that make models sing.
- **Data Science**: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter, and a knack for learning new shit.

More dope projects coming soon — stay tuned!
